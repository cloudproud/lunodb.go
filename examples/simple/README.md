# Simple Connector

This example demonstrates a minimal LunoDB connector that fetches live weather data from the [wttr.in](wttr.in) API and exposes it as a virtual table via SQL.

## 🙏 Special Thanks

This example relies on the awesome [wttr.in](wttr.in) weather API. Huge thanks to the [wttr team](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in) for providing a simple and powerful public service!
